    <h1 class="front_page">The value of Pair Programming</h1>
    <p>Pair Programing is two coders working together simultaneously. This provides a number of advantanges over programming alone. Including:</p>
        <ul class="front_page_lists">
          <li>One Coder can watch for typos, this seems to me the most important part.</li>
          <li>Two brains working on the problem means less running off to figure out how, "..to do that thing again?"</li>
          <li>These make for faster devlopment.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1 class="front_page">Pair Programming at DBC</h1>

    <p>With each student pairing with each other student we will becoem very comfortable with pairing with lots of people. A valuable skill. Also we will each get an oppurtunity to learn what the other knows. This goes both ways.</p>
    <h1 class="front_page">Driver vs Navigator</h1>
    <p>The Driver Types and Composes the code. The Navigator watches and polices typos and logic errors.

    <h1 class="front_page">Reflection</h1>
    <p>First I got to do this alone. Wo is me. Second Annie, my guide,  was terrific and spent a loong time on forcing me to produce well formated code. And talking about focusing on eliminating bad habits now, as the little mistakes we make we will make thousands of times, and that wasted time adds up. I sort of thought that small efficiency improvements would come after some technical sofistification, but now I am getting to work on it now.</p>
