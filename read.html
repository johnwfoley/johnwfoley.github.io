            <h5>c9-questions</h5>

    <p>This week, we are supposed to be talking about what makes a good question.</p>


<p>uh... Yea I guess that's important... no that's really important and I someday hope to be any good at that at all. But I am much much more interested in good answers. and here's why: </p>

<p>Oh so many of them are so so terrible.</p>

<p>Right now, I am a beginner, or Begin-gineer (that's dumb but we had out first Cohort meet up tonight and ... there were shots...  where was I?  RIGHT!</p>

<h1> Two kinds of Answers </h1>

<p>Meet Tom: Tom grew up in a house that spoke French and English, moved to France, majored in Renaissance Literature, currently lives in Paris, and teaches creative writing at the Sorbonne.</p>
<p>He is really good at French. </p>

<p>Meet Bob: Bob has been using Rosetta Stone to learn to speak French. He is on Day 10. He likes to watch his favorite movies with the audio set to French. Progress is slow.</p>

<p>See where I am going with this right? </p>
<p> If Bob asks what the third-person plural, imperative form of "to be" is? What he wants is the shortest possible, most direct answer. Phrased in a way he can comprehend with his limited skill set.
<p>If he asks Tom, he might get an answer that is meaningful to him, but he might get a 75 page thesis on why there kind of isn't a third person imperative form of "To be" in French</p>

<p> in short the answer must take into account the learning level of the questioner.</p>

<p> I forgot Alan, Alan is 4 week into his second semester of college French. In many ways he is really the guy Bob should talk to, but it depends on the question. Alan is really strong on the foundations. "How do you say "Duck" but not like the fowl, like the verb, to crouch down lest you get a pie in the face Duck!(again the imperative.)</p>

<p>Oh but Alan is not um, how to say this, Bob intimidates the hell out of Alan so, when Alan tries to explain that there kinda of isn't an imperative for or "To Be".. his answer is a little muddled, because A: It's a subtle question who's answer is challenging. B: Alan doesn't have a super great handle on the answer anyway, and C: Because he is a little intimidated, Alan goes way overboard on the answer dragging in other concepts as examples to explain the in it. Which of course Bob has no context for.<p>


<p> So where to go with this? Well, for me, I must always remember that I am currently a Bob, hopefully on my way to becoming an Alan.</p>

<p> There are so many answers that fly right over my head. The kids on Stack overflow so often seem to value complexity over simplicity.</p>

<p> but that may not be a bad thing just a bad thing for me.<p>

<p> Today I am learning French, and all I want it to write grammatically correct sentences. Tomorrow, hopefully, tomorrow I will write poetry.</p>

<p>When I first saw the Terminator, I was deeply troubled by the time paradox. I watched a lot of Dr. Who as a kid so I was pretty familiar with the basics of time travel. But Terminator was the first one with a ... wait this can never happen.</p>



<p>Becasue the thing with Time Paradoxes is, at some point there must have been a "First Time Through".</p>

<p>At some point there must have been a Sarah Connor who got pregnant and had a boy John Connor who's dad WASN'T Kyle Reese, but who grew up to survive the war with the machines, and lead humanity to victory and send Kyle Back to meet Sarah Conner.</p>
<p> And THAT's where the paradox starts.<p/>

  <p> So young me was always facinated by that first time through. What we shall call the Prime Iteration. Becasue after that everything changes.</p>
  <p>And that is all anyone seems to care about.</p>

<h3>And here's the segue..<h3>
  <h4>spoiler alert: there is no segue.</h4>

<h3>Recursion</h3>

<blockquote>It is perfectly okay for a function to call itself, as long as it takes care not to overflow the stack. <br>
-- Marijn Haverbeke, Eloquent Jvascript</blockquote>

<blockquote>A function that calls itself from inside itself is a slap in the face to the laws of nature, and I wouldn't let one date my sister.<br>
-- Me, this Blog, right now.</blockquote>


<p>Here take a look at this.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">function power(base, exponent) {
  <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> (exponent <span style="color: #333333">==</span> <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">0</span>)
    <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">1</span>;
  <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">else</span>
    <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">return</span> base <span style="color: #333333">*</span> power(base, exponent <span style="color: #333333">-</span> <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">1</span>);
}

console<span style="color: #333333">.</span>log(power(<span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">2</span>, <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">4</span>));
<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #fff0ff">//</span> <span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">=></span> <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">16</span>
</pre></div>



<p>Here is a power function, uh, function.<br>
but you can see in the 'else' segment of the if statement<br> the function, 'power' is.. is
<em>CALLING ITSELF!</em></p>

<p> This raises new and troubling questions</p>

<p>How do you call a function from inside a function. By virtue of the fact that you are calling from inside it.. by definition you aren't done defining it. How can you call it before you are done defining it? Also why?</p>

<p>If every time this thing iterates its going to call itself again.. Its turtles all the way down, it can never end.</p>

<p>Now I would really like to talk about Chaos by James Gleik, and spend a moment on Infinite sets in bounded systems, but that's just me showing off, instead I will drag us back to my Terminator obsession.</p>

<p>There had to be a Prime Iteration, a first time through the loop just to get it started.<br> I don't need to tell you recursion is a bit tricky to get right. Lots of opportunity to start an infinite loop.</p>

<p>So for this first time through they set up some ground rules. In this function, right at the start they create this escape clause<br>with the <b>if</b> statement: <b>if (exponent == 0) return 0;</b></p>

<p>Okay now we have a good feeling that this won't last forever. Not entirely sure why not, but a good guess is, someplace, in a little bit, something will be decrementing <b>exponent</b>. And sure enough, there it is in the <b>else</b> half of the statement. In that unholy call to <b>power</b>. But at least its there, so no matter how off-the-rails things go we know that every time this function runs through its little loop, even though its calling itself, <b>exponent</b> is going to be decremented a little each time and eventually <b>exponent</b> will = 0 and get the hell out of there.</p>

<h1>Great so now we know how it ends</h1>
<p>This the part where it get a little weird visually. Let us go through each iteration and see what is happening. Starting with the given <b>base</b> and <b>exponent</b>: 2 and 4.</p>

<p>First time through:  <b>base = 2</b>, <b>exponent = 4</b></p>
<p>2 * power( 2, exponent - 1)   <== <b>exponent = 4</b> but now they've called power again so</p>
<p>----> 2 * power( 2, exponent - 1) <== <b>exponent = 3</b> but here's power again so</p>
<p>----> ---->2 * power( 2, exponent - 1) <== <b>exponent = 2</b> and power again so</p>
<p>----> ----> ---->2 * power( 2, exponent - 1 ) <== but <em>now</em> <b>Exponent = 1</b> and this call to power passes exponent - 1, so 0.
AND have that escape clause in the beginning that returns 0 if exponent == 1.</p>

<p> Now depending on how you look at it, and whichever way you look at it is fine. We have recursed, thru all the iterations available to us as they were set up by that first If statement.</p>

  <blockquote>Effectively you get: (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * 1)))) Where the innermost set of parentheses corresponds to the last value of exponent(0)

  <p>And now you can back out and run the function and get the result 12.
  uh ,16 actually , but the important thing is to understand what's happening.</p>

            <h4> c3_thinking-style</h4>


   <p>According to the test, my GregorC thinking style is Concrete Random AND Abstract Random.</p>

   <p>I learn best when; I am able to use trial and error, compete with others, and work independantly. While simultaneously given; broad general guidelines, participate in group activities and maintain friendly relationships.</p>

    <p>..Uh. Okay previous edits of this paragraph were, a little snarky. I will instead only say that I think the GregorC stuff is a little flimsy and sounds more like a horoscope than anything you really get much utility out of, but your mileage may vary.</p>


  <h4>Growth Mindset and Phase 0 So Far.</h4>
  <h5>Hard Things are Hard</h5>

   <p>I'm not 25 anymore but if I could tell that guy something it would be this:</p>
   <p>There's <em>not liking</em>  Something because you don't like it.</p>
   <p> And there's not liking it because <strong>ITS HARD RIGHT NOW</strong>.<p>
  <p>This idea, I think encapsulates a growth mindset. It pre-supposes that change is possible, it even reminds us that while it may not be fun, it will be worthwhile.</p>

<h5>You will think there should be a segue here but.. wait for it</h5>

<p> I do not like Chinese Opera. I have relatives who perform it and I have seen it and let me tell you, it is a real challenge. I don't speak Mandarin, its not my culture in the first place, it has nothing in common with anything I do like, and I just have no desire to become someone who would like it, anyway.<p>

<p>I don't think it is BAD or EVIL or STUPID. I don't think <strong>IT SHOULDN'T EXIST</strong>. It's just not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>I'm trying to set this up as an example of "I just don't like it".</p>

<p>Skiing,  driving stick,  a musical instrument,  small talk at parties with strangers ..learning to do these things absolutely sucked. But they where totally worthwhile.</p>
<p> It was hard, and at the time, I was really not enjoying it. I did not like it. But it passed.</p>


<h4>First Three Weeks</h4>
   <h5>Its the little things</h5>

   <p>Keeping all that in mind, I'm not sure how I feel about HTML and CSS. I think its just frustrating that I'm not very good at it. This will pass and I will get better.</p>

   <p> The Ruby stuff in week three was such a relief. First, you aren't so freaked out about design and visual appeal, just getting the answer. There is no visual interpretation to "which one is the shortest string in the array".<p>

    <p> But its the small things. A part of me wants to focus on the BIG STUFF. Doing the Challenges.</p>
    <p>But there is rather a lot of small stuff. Getting everything up on Github, getting your web site to point correctly, doing reflections, the final submission on Socrates, arranging Pairing, good god.<p>

    <p> all that adds up to a lot of time when you aren't working on the big stuff.</p>
    <p> But I am sure that will pass.</p>
    <p>But Chinese opera.. no way man.</p>

   <h2></h2>

   <p>Remember those cartoons that showed you what life would be like in the future? They had some recurring themes. Flying Cars, living in space and one you heard over-and over; robots taking over for man in the manual labor department. Guaranteeing man less work-time and more time for "leisure". </p>

   <p>Now I look and see that all the people who have been spared the physical or repetitive drudgery of their jobs are now in fact, unemployed. Upside; more time For Leisure! Downside; .. oh wait.  </p>

    <p>There are here in Oakland Ca. Many many opportunities for children to learn to code, produce video, learn to play music. Costs are from top tier to free. But when you start to look out for it, there is a lot of stuff to help children acquire marketable skills early and for cheap.</p>


  <h4>And we need to knock that off.</h4>
  <h5>But what about the <strike>children</strike> Baby Boomers?</h5>

   <p>All I'm saying is there are a lot of older adults who have lost or are going to  lose their jobs and need to learn new skills. And while learning to weld is both fun and lucrative (provided you can move to North Dakota, we can't teach you to weld over the internet.</p>

  <p> This is my point, if technology is going to wipe out all these jobs but not revolutionize society enough that all these newly Leisure-Time-Enabled adults can still feed themselves. The least it could do is provide them with some new job skills.

  <p> One might ask, so you want to teach a bunch of 67 year olds to code?<p>

  <p> Yep, and System Administration and tech support. And I want to do it for free.</p>

  <p> And yes I'm aware of the irony of training those who lost their living to technology to serve it. Its Twilight Zones all the way down.

<p>But here's why. One, they're old. They can't all go and learn to be plummer and car mechanics. Two Its good for them. Want to forestall age related mental diminishment Nothing beats learning new skills that are WAAAAY out of your comfort zone. Three Times change but there will always be something like a computer on something like a desk, and it will need programming, maintenance and fixing. Today Tomorrow, Forever. </p>

<p>Until Technology sufficiently revolutionizes society so that we can spend all day in our flying car enjoying our Leisure.</p>

<p> And how are you going to do this?</p>

<p>  whoa, Hey! look at the time...
