    <p>I'm excited! I wish Phase 1 could start right now. It is clear from the video that they are constantly trying new things and I want to see that in action. This is clearly an educational situation unlike anything I have experienced before and want to see what the heck is going on.</p>

    <p>I'm nervous because of course I don't feel smart enough, or fast enough or experienced enough but I'm gonna show a little faith and keep grinding through Phase 0 and see what happens.</p>
