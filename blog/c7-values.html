<p>My favorite value, and its not on the list, is Harmony.</p>

<p>I know, how hippy-dippy does that sound?</p>

<p>But I believe the thing that makes people different from the other apes is that we can cooperate like nothing else on earth.</p>

<p>Oh sure; war and history and religion and all that..<br>
but you should see what baboons do to each other.<br>
Really, there is just no comparison.<br>
Sure you always hear about the loving way of the Bonobos, but that's when they have plenty to eat,<br>
you should see those dudes when there is a resource scarcity.<br> Not so much with the mutual grooming then.</p>

<p>Primatologists will tell you, genetically, we are functionally the same as the apes, but man did you see that satellite land on that comet?</p>

<p>How's your space program going chimpanzee's?</p>

<p>I feel I have drifted. Oh right Harmony.</p>

<p>I'm not saying every second of everyday has to be spent striving to cooperate better with every single person around us.
Just don't add a bunch of unnecessary friction the world.</p>

<p>If you need to shut up for ten minutes about the supremacy of Sam Adam's beer when you meet your fiance's brother for the first time...</p>

<p>What is to be gained, by dissing Leinenkugel's.</p>

<p>(First the monkey thing and the then the beer thing? Two metaphors? That's just bad writing.)</p>
