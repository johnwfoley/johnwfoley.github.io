<h1>Feedback and Pairing</h1>

<p> Oh Pairing, you are such a cool idea, but so hard to get right.</p>

<p> Imagine if you will, two elevator repair men. They've been doing this for over 20 years betweeen them. Each knows some tricks the other doesn't, but they share a base level knowledge. Together when faced with a novel situation, can talk out their strategies, one picks up where the other drops off, they both get excited about clever solutions to difficult problems. But they also pick up the mundane stuff... "You didn't turn off that breaker.."</p>

<p>I can't wait until I am that good at programming. But I'm not. I need 15 minutes to look at the code to even begin to have an idea what its doing. And trying to explain it to someone else just adds A LOT of time to the process. </p>

<p> People who just start typing elaborate loops to iterate through Hashes, BLOW ME AWAY.</p>

<p>So when I do pair, its usually pretty stressful, I feel very much like, it would be nice if I could look at this on my own for a few minutes and come back with something constructive to add. After about an hour I just have to stop altogether. By then we almost always have a decent pseudocode or rough initial solution. And by then I am done. I will gladly finish this up on my own. Cheers!</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>Oh feedback is great. But no one here is Mean or Rude. They are all very kind. So really the only metric worth measuring is whether the criticism they give is actionable or not.</p>
