<p>When I was first interviewed for DBC, it was last March, they were moving to Google Hangouts from Skype.</p>

<p>For my interview, that I had to wait, like 5 weeks to get, I was going to be asked questions about my current ruby knowledge, given some puzzles to solve and chat, I guess. Interview stuff.</p>

<p>It was set for 10:30am on a Thursday morning. The interviewer was.. I forget his name but I Google-stalked the hell out of him.</p>

<p>I studied my "Learn to Program" and I did my Code School excercises and I read the appropriate chapters in "Search Inside Yourself", I even started meditating. About 5 - 10 minutes a day when I wasn't too busy, so maybe 3-5 days a week.</p>

<p>I was nervous as hell becasue I really wanted to do this. One way or another; get through DBC and your direction in this world is severly changed. And I have found as an adult that when I care about things they make we very nervous.</p>

<p>Thurday comes and I'm vibrating with butterflies, quite possibly litterally shaking. Trying to calm down, just not able to.</p>

<p>But eventually its 10:20. The call is in 10 minutes. I have been clearly instructed that the call will be on skype and that I should keep skype open becasue of .. reasons...</p>

<p>Anyway, becasue I have google stalked this poor interviewer I know he has interviews all morning, so of course he will run late.</p>

<p>So at 10:31 When I have heard nothing, I do not panic. I am cool, I am not some kind of Hot-Head. I am exactly the person they want for this program. No email, no skype, no worries. He is busy and he will get back to me when he is ready.</p>

<p>So at 10:40 when I still haven't heard anything, I am, well appalled to see two new emails.<br>
1. You missed your interview and you application to Dev Bootcamp is being disregarded.<br>
2. An earlier email: Here is the link to the Google Hangout for your interview.</p>


<p>Now I would like to tell you that I took three measured breaths and found my center and thought silently, "oh well".</p>

<p>That is not what happened. I flipped the f- out.</p>

<p>And as quick as I could, I installed the Google Hangout thing, and called him back.</p>

<p>And that is when something miraculous happened.</p>

<p>Instead of the interviewer picking up the Hangout and me SCREAMING at him:</p>

<p>"You said SKYPE!<br>
I have been waiting Months!<br>
I am NOT starting over!<br>
I will go someplace else you "so-and-so"! etc..</p>


<p>no no.<br>
Insted a tiny voice in my head pipped up and said, what if we try a different tone. Perhaps apologetic?</p>

<p>And that is when Karim Bishay, (not the interviewer I had been Google-stalking), picked up the hangout.
And I put on a big smile and I .. apologized.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, I thought we were going to do this on Skype, I just saw the link to Google hangout"
All self-recriminatory smiles.<br> Perhaps the greatest performance of my career.</p>

<p>He was, as I suspect he always is, totally cool about it. No problem. We did the interview, I made jokes, he laughed, I think genuinely.</p>

<p>I was not a complete idiot.</p>

<p>I got out of the interview feeling that it went as well as it possibly could.</p>

<p>Afterwards I had so much pent up nervous energy I almost fainted.</p>

<p>I have told this story about 20 times.<br>
Some people believe that the Skype/Google mix up is actually an elaborate psychological test performed by Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>I remain skeptical.</p>

<p>But the one thing I know, with a fervent religious faith is: if I gone with outrage, instead of a more measured response, I, absolutely, would not be here now.<br>
There is a area of you brain, in the frontal cortex, that is responsible for impulse control.<br>
It has been shown to react positively to meditation.<br>
That little voice in my head saved my ass.<br>
Maybe it was the meditation.</p>
