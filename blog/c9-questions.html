<p>This week, we are supposed to be talking about what makes a good question.</p>


<p>uh... Yea I guess that's important... no that's really important and I someday hope to be any good at that at all. But I am much much more interested in good answers. and here's why: </p>

<p>Oh so many of them are so so terrible.</p>

<p>Right now, I am a beginner, or Begin-gineer (that's dumb but we had out first Cohort meet up tonight and ... there were shots...  where was I?  RIGHT!</p>

<h1> Two kinds of Answers </h1>

<p>Meet Tom: Tom grew up in a house that spoke French and English, moved to France, majored in Renaissance Literature, currently lives in Paris, and teaches creative writing at the Sorbonne.</p>
<p>He is really good at French. </p>

<p>Meet Bob: Bob has been using Rosetta Stone to learn to speak French. He is on Day 10. He likes to watch his favorite movies with the audio set to French. Progress is slow.</p>

<p>See where I am going with this right? </p>
<p> If Bob asks what the third-person plural, imperative form of "to be" is? What he wants is the shortest possible, most direct answer. Phrased in a way he can comprehend with his limited skill set.
<p>If he asks Tom, he might get an answer that is meaningful to him, but he might get a 75 page thesis on why there kind of isn't a third person imperative form of "To be" in French</p>

<p> in short the answer must take into account the learning level of the questioner.</p>

<p> I forgot Alan, Alan is 4 week into his second semester of college French. In many ways he is really the guy Bob should talk to, but it depends on the question. Alan is really strong on the foundations. "How do you say "Duck" but not like the fowl, like the verb, to crouch down lest you get a pie in the face Duck!(again the imperative.)</p>

<p>Oh but Alan is not um, how to say this, Bob intimidates the hell out of Alan so, when Alan tries to explain that there kinda of isn't an imperative for or "To Be".. his answer is a little muddled, because A: It's a subtle question who's answer is challenging. B: Alan doesn't have a super great handle on the answer anyway, and C: Because he is a little intimidated, Alan goes way overboard on the answer dragging in other concepts as examples to explain the in it. Which of course Bob has no context for.<p>


<p> So where to go with this? Well, for me, I must always remember that I am currently a Bob, hopefully on my way to becoming an Alan.</p>

<p> There are so many answers that fly right over my head. The kids on Stack overflow so often seem to value complexity over simplicity.</p>

<p> but that may not be a bad thing just a bad thing for me.<p>

<p> Today I am learning French, and all I want it to write grammatically correct sentences. Tomorrow, hopefully, tomorrow I will write poetry.</p>
