  <h1>Stereotyped Threat</h1>
  <h2>Social Psychology and Literary Criticism</h2>

<p>Stereotyped Threat is this idea that if you are a member of a group about whom there are stereotypes, you might manifest a less or greater capacity, in a particular area of endeavor that corresponds with that stereotype, under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>For example, If you are taking a math test and you happen to be some extraction of Asian, and the rest of the test takers ARE NOT. Stereotype Threat says you will score better than normal on such a math test if we put you in a room full of people who are not Asian, and spend a moment remarking on belief that Asians in general are good at math.

<p></p>I feel obliged to say if I have said anything, about anyone, that anybody finds offensive? Sorry, I'm just trying to explain the concept.

<p></p>In the interest of science I want to further elaborate on the second paragraph. I think actually if we take a decent sized sample of Asian people, and we place some of them in a room with folks who are not, and take the other half and place them in a room with people who are; There is measurable difference in the average score of the Asian test takers. You, Asian person from paragraph one you probably won't get a huge grade increase. But when we do this many times the result is noticeable.</p>

<p>But even that isn't enough, because Stereotype Threat works both ways. The non Asians might be reacting badly due to their crippling lack of Asian-ness and that can depress their test results.</p>

<p>Anyway the niggling details of proper experimental design to isolate phenomena like this is quite the rat hole. The upshot is if you put someone in a situation where a stereotype they fit into (French people and cooking!) and you surround them with people who don't embody that stereotype (my siblings!)
AND and this part upsets me a little, put everyone in mind of that exact stereotype. You may get a measurable result in a direction that confirms the  stereotype.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to hear I and others have a problem with this.
(Oh skepticism from an Atheist, what a surprise. I wonder if I will also be short and rude to people who disagree with me. Probably not, I'm not that kind of Atheist.) (But Stereotype Threat say I will be.)</p></p>

<p>Anyway I am pretty sure this is just a subset of Psychological priming. Adding stereotypes into the mix is a mistaken idea from the start.</p>


<h1>But what about me</h1>

<p></p>Right, it hasn't passed my attention that making us research Stereotyped Threat and considering what threats we ourselves might be.. uh, threateNd by, IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING THAT CAUSES STEREOTYPED THREAT. Nice one DBC.</p>

<p>Anyhow I'm 43 and white and male. I really have no idea what it means to be the object of a negative stereotype. Except I'm quite a bit older than the other students, and I guess one might start worrying that I don't digest information the way I used to or the brain doesn't fire on all cylinders the way it might.</p>

<p>To be honest I'm just not gonna worry about this at all. If you got through the interview and Phase 0 then as far as I'm concerned you know at least as much as I do. And that makes you a resource. <strike>To be exploited.</strike></p>
