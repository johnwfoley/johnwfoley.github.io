   <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
   <h2>Aquarius is rising in the House of Cancer</h2>

   <p>According to the test, my GregorC thinking style is Concrete Random AND Abstract Random.</p>

   <p>I learn best when; I am able to use trial and error, compete with others, and work independantly. While simultaneously given; broad general guidelines, participate in group activities and maintain friendly relationships.</p>

    <p>..Uh. Okay previous edits of this paragraph were, a little snarky. I will instead only say that I think the GregorC stuff is a little flimsy and sounds more like a horoscope than anything you really get much utility out of, but your mileage may vary.</p>


  <h1>Growth Mindset and Phase 0 So Far.</h1>
  <h2>Hard Things are Hard</h2>

   <p>I'm not 25 anymore but if I could tell that guy something it would be this:</p>
   <p>There's Not Liking Something becasue you don't like it.</p>
   <p> And there's not liking it becasue ITS HARD RIGHT NOW.<p>
  <p>This idea, I think encapsulates a growth mindset. It pre-supposes that change is possible, it even reminds us that while it may not be fun, it will be worthwhile.</p>

<p> I do not like Chinese Opera. I have relatives who perform it and I have seen it and let me tell you, it is a real challenge. I don't speak Mandarin, its not my culture in the first place, it has nothing in common with anythign I do like and I just have no desire to become someone who would like it anyway.<p>

<p>I don't think it is BAD or EVIL or STUPID. I don't think IT SHOULDN'T EXIST. It's just not my cup of tea. I just don't like it very much</p>

<p>I'm trying to set this up as an example of "I just don't like it".</p>

<p>Skiing,  driving stick,  a musical instrument,  small talk at parties with strangers ..learning to do these things absolutely sucked. But they where totally worthwile.</p>
<p> It was hard, and at the time, I was really not enjoying it. I did not like it. But it passed.</p>


<h1>First Three Weeks</h1>
   <h2>Its the little things</h2>

   <p>Keeping all that in mind, I'm not sure how I feel about HTML and CSS. I think its just frustrating that I'm not very good at it. This will pass and I will get better.</p>

   <p> The Ruby stuff in week three was such a relief. First, you aren't so freaked out about design and visual appeal, just getting the answer. There is no visual interpretation to "which one is the shortest string in the array".<p>

    <p> But its the small things. A part of me wants to focus on the BIG STUFF. Doing the Challenges.</p>
    <p>But there is rather a lot of small stuff. Getting everythign up on Git, getting your web site to point correctly, doing reflections, the final submission on Socrates, arranging Pairing, god god.<p>

    <p> all that adds up to a lot of time when you aren't working on the big stuff.</p>
    <p> But I am sure that will pass.</p>
    <p>But Chinese opera.. no way man.</p>
