   <h1>More time for Leisure</h1>
   <h2></h2>

   <p>Remember those cartoons that showed you what life would be like in the future? They had some recurring themes. Flying Cars, living in space and one you heard over-and over; robots taking over for man in the manual labor department. Guaranteeing man less work-time and more time for "leisure". </p>

   <p>Now I look and see that all the people who have been spared the physical or repetitive drudgery of their jobs are now in fact, unemployed. Upside; more time For Leisure! Downside; .. oh wait.  </p>

    <p>There are here in Oakland Ca. Many many opportunities for children to learn to code, produce video, learn to play music. Costs are from top tier to free. But when you start to look out for it, there is a lot of stuff to help children acquire marketable skills early and for cheap.</p>


  <h1>And we need to knock that off.</h1>
  <h2>But what about the <strike>children</strike> Baby Boomers?</h2>

   <p>All I'm saying is there are a lot of older adults who have lost or are going to  lose their jobs and need to learn new skills. And while learning to weld is both fun and lucrative (provided you can move to North Dakota, we can't teach you to weld over the internet.</p>

  <p> This is my point, if technology is going to wipe out all these jobs but not revolutionize society enough that all these newly Leisure-Time-Enabled adults can still feed themselves. The least it could do is provide them with some new job skills.

  <p> One might ask, so you want to teach a bunch of 67 year olds to code?<p>

  <p> Yep, and System Administration and tech support. And I want to do it for free.</p>

  <p> And yes I'm aware of the irony of training those who lost their living to technology to serve it. Its Twilight Zones all the way down.

<p>But here's why. One, they're old. They can't all go and learn to be plummer and car mechanics. Two Its good for them. Want to forestall age related mental diminishment Nothing beats learning new skills that are WAAAAY out of your comfort zone. Three Times change but there will always be something like a computer on something like a desk, and it will need programming, maintenance and fixing. Today Tomorrow, Forever. </p>

<p>Until Technology sufficiently revolutionizes society so that we can spend all day in our flying car enjoying our Leisure.</p>

<p> And how are you going to do this?</p>

<p>  whoa, Hey! look at the time...
