## A million words for folder. ##

There's probably a good reason for this.

	Hey, let me ask you something?


	Do you ever make mistakes?

	Do you have any regrets?

	Do you ever wish you could go back a second ..

	..and maybe not; say, or do, or forget, that thing you just did.

	Just a second, a second chance, just a little one.

Well let me tell you about my little friend Git. And his Mom Github.
Oh these two. They will follow you around and write down every little thing you do, and keep a copy of every document, you tell her,  in Github's purse. Github will not let you hold your won ticket to for the plane. Remember last time?


Sure it's a little creepy. But put them together, and they are a freaking __time machine!__

	Did you delete the wrong file?
	Boo-Yah! Time machine! It's BACK!


Did you just completely forget why this giant chunk of code is even here and why did you put it here in the first place?

Boo-Yah! Time machine!

	Did Steve just "Fix" the login module and now nothing works at all? Classic Steve!
	Boo-Yah! Time machine!

Will it save your ass?
You know it will!

	Will it store and distribute code in the cloud? Accessible from anywhere while 	simultaneously protecting the work from ministrations of villains like Steve. Oh Steve.

	You know it will!

Is it annoying?
Oh.. oh god yes.
